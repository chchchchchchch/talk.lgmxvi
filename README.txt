TALK AT THE LIBRE GRAPHICS MEETING 2016
---------------------------------------

While looking for a personal position within increasingly
homogenized computational environments I discovered the
world of free culture some years ago.

From the direction of DIY and alternative copyright practises
I proceeded slowly to the technological aspects of free software.
The book 'How I stopped to learn programming and love the Bash'
collects and revisits memories of growing within and into free
software, memories of expanding my personal comfort zone.
The GNU Bourne-Again SHell was and still is a big inspiration
towards a practise, not so much focussed on 'writing code' but
'embracing connectivity'.

The presentation will summarizes the development, ideas and
learnings behind the process of making a book making workflow
within and through a networked environment based on f/l/os software.
